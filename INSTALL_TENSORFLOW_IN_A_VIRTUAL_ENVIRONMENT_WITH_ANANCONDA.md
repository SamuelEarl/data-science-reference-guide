# Install TensorFlow in a virtual environment with Anaconda

NOTE: Refer to the `HOW_TO_SETUP_DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECTS.md` file for more information on installing Anaconda, creating a virtual environment, and working with Python inside of VSCode (with or without Python Notebooks).

```
conda create -n tf tensorflow
conda activate tf
```

NOTE: It will take several minutes to install TensorFlow along with all of the necessary packages.
